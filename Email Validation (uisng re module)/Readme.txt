The email validation program check wheather the given email is valid or not
- This can be done by verfing that the email follow the all give below properties
    -alphabets (a-z)
    -integer (0-9)
    - ' . ' must only one time 
    - ' @ ' also only one time
    - after . their is only 2 or 3 letter be present (such as .com ,.in like that ) 

-In python programing language we have re module (re stands for regular expression)

Regular expressions (regex), also known as rational expressions, are a concise and powerful way to define patterns for searching, matching, and manipulating text data. Here's a quick breakdown:

What they do:

Define patterns to search for specific characters, sequences, or complex structures within text.
Offer a flexible way to identify and extract specific information from text.
How they work:

Use a special syntax with metacharacters like . (matches any character), * (matches zero or more repetitions), + (matches one or more repetitions), [] (defines character sets), etc.
Allow for capturing specific parts of the matched text using parentheses.
Common uses:

Extracting data: Emails, phone numbers, dates, etc., from text files or logs.
Validating user input: Ensuring formats like email addresses or usernames meet specific criteria.
Text cleaning and manipulation: Removing unwanted characters, replacing patterns, or transforming text.
Search and replace operations: Finding and replacing specific text patterns across large datasets.
Benefits:

Concise and expressive way to define complex text patterns.
Reusable across different programs and functionalities.
Powerful tool for text processing tasks.

Remember: Regex can have a bit of a learning curve, but it's a valuable skill for anyone working with text data in Python or other programming languages.
