Project Title: Face Recognition Attendance System

Introduction

This project is a Python-based application designed to automate attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. It leverages the OpenCV library for image processing and machine learning techniques to accurately identify individuals and record their presence.

Key Features

Facial Recognition: Captures and analyzes facial images to identify individuals from a pre-existing database.
Attendance Tracking: Records attendance information based on successful identification, storing data in a structured format.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive graphical user interface for easy operation.
Customizability: Allows for customization of the database, attendance records, and system settings.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x
OpenCV library (install using pip install opencv-python)
NumPy library (install using pip install numpy)
Scikit - learn library

Add Faces:
Open the application and navigate to the "Add Faces" section.
Capture or upload images of individuals to be added to the database.
Provide corresponding names for each individual.
Mark Attendance:
Launch the attendance marking module.
Position the camera to capture faces.
The system will attempt to identify individuals based on their facial features.
Successful identifications will be recorded in the attendance log.

Data Structure

faces_data.pkl: A serialized Python object containing facial image data and corresponding labels.
names.pkl: A serialized Python object storing the names associated with each facial image.
attendance_log.csv: A CSV file containing attendance records, including timestamps and identified individuals.
Customization

Database: Modify the code to integrate with different database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) if needed.
Attendance Records: Customize the format and content of attendance records to suit specific requirements.
System Settings: Adjust parameters related to facial recognition accuracy, camera settings, and other system behaviors.

Known Issues and Limitations

Lighting Conditions: The system may be sensitive to variations in lighting conditions, potentially affecting recognition accuracy.
Image Quality: Low-resolution or blurry images can impact identification.
Occlusions: Partial face occlusions (e.g., by hair, glasses) can hinder recognition.
